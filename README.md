# **ASHES**
## or, _Apocalypse Safe Haven Evacuation System_

ASHES is a multiplayer text game, operating through a discord bot.

### A Forewarning
_ASHES is not a complete game as of yet. Key features are missing._
### Setup
You'll need a discord server, and you might want some friends.
 1. Use this [Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=918441057165914122&permissions=311385131008&scope=bot) to bring the bot to the server.
 2. In the server, use the `/registerserver` command.
 3. Have everyone willing to play use the `/installplayer` command. The bot will create a thread and ask some questions - respond to them however you'd like to.
 4. You're ready to play! `/scavenge` is used to look for materials, and `/arc` helps you put them towards the endgame. `/myinfo` is a status checker, and includes customizable name/description fields.
